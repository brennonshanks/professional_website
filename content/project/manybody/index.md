Neutron/X-ray diffraction measurements can be utilized to quantify many-body and quantum effects at the same length scale as the interatomic interactions. We use a combination of electron structure theory and structure-optimized potential refinement to directly quantify the influence of third- and higher-order effects for real fluid ensembles. We have also used SOPR to provide the first experimental evidence for quantum Drude oscillator type behavior in the liquid state [1].
