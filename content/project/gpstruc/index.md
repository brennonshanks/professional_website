Gaussian processes offer a Bayesian framework for analyzing complex experimental data and interatomic interactions while enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification and propagation (UQ/P). We apply state-of-the-art Gaussian process methods, including spectral and non-stationary kernel designs [1], to develop next-generation scattering analysis tools and machine-learned potentials that integrate experimental data with theoretical models. This framework allows us to throw all available experimental data in the hopper while preserving established physical knowledge accumulated through generations of scientific innovation and discovery.
