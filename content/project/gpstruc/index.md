Gaussian processes can model complex experimental data and interatomic interactions while enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification and propagation within a Bayesian framework. We apply state-of-the-art GP methods, including spectral and non-stationary kernel designs [1], to develop next-generation molecular simulation tools such as uncertainty-aware machine learning potentials .
