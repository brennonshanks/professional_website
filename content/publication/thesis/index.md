abstract: This dissertation is founded on the central notion that structural correlations in dense fluids, such as dense gases, liquids, and glasses, are directly related to fundamental interatomic forces. This relationship was identified early in the development of statistical theories of fluids through the mathematical formulations of Gibbs in the 1910s. However, it took nearly 80 years before practical implementations of structure-based theories became widely used for interpreting and understanding the atomic structures of fluids from experimental X-ray and neutron scattering data. The breakthrough in successfully applying structure-potential relations is largely attributed to the advancements in molecular mechanics simulations and the enhancement of computational resources. Despite advancements in understanding the relationship between structure and interatomic forces, a significant gap remains. Current techniques for interpreting experimental scattering measurements are widely used, yet there is little evidence that they yield physically accurate predictions for interatomic forces. In fact, it is generally assumed that these methods produce interatomic forces that poorly model the atomistic and thermodynamic behavior of fluids, rendering them unreliable and non-transferable. This thesis aims to address these limitations by refining the statistical theory, computational methods, and philosophical approach to structure-based analyses, thereby developing more robust and accurate techniques for characterizing structure-potential relationships.
