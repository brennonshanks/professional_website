	abstract = {While Bayesian inference is the gold standard for uncertainty quantification and propagation, its use within physical chemistry encounters formidable computational barriers. These bottlenecks are magnified for modeling data with many independent variables, such as X-ray/neutron scattering patterns and electromagnetic spectra. To address this challenge, we employ local Gaussian process (LGP) surrogate models to accelerate Bayesian optimization over these complex thermophysical properties. The time-complexity of the LGPs scales linearly in the number of independent variables, in stark contrast to the computationally expensive cubic scaling of conventional Gaussian processes. To illustrate the method, we trained a LGP surrogate model on the radial distribution function of liquid neon and observed a 1,760,000-fold speed-up compared to molecular dynamics simulation, beating a conventional GP by three orders-of-magnitude. We conclude that LGPs are robust and efficient surrogate models poised to expand the application of Bayesian inference in molecular simulations to a broad spectrum of experimental data.},
