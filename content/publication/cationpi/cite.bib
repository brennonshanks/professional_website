	abstract = {Cation−π interactions involving the tetramethylammonium motif are prevalent in biological systems, playing crucial roles in membrane protein function, DNA expression regulation, and protein folding. However, accurately modeling cation−π interactions where electronic polarization plays a critical role is computationally challenging, especially in large biomolecular systems. This study implements a physically justified electronic continuum correction (ECC) to the CHARMM36 force field, scaling ionic charges by a factor of 0.75 to effectively account for electronic polarization without additional computational overhead. This approach, while not specifically designed for cation−π interactions, is shown here to significantly improve predictions of the structure of an aqueous tetramethylammonium–pyridine complex as compared to neutron diffraction data. This result, together with computational predictions for the structure of the aqueous tetramethylammonium–phenol complex, underscores the potential of ECC as a versatile method to improve the description of cation−π interactions in biomolecular simulations.},
