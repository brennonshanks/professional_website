I am a statistical thermodynamics researcher that applies molecular dynamics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning to study liquid state materials. My current research projects include developing machine learning approaches for neutron scattering analysis, thermodynamic characterization of high pressure and temperature liquids and liquid metals, and fundamental analysis of many-body interactions from neutron scattering experiments.
